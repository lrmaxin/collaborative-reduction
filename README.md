Thesis data set

Data set introduction

a) All datasets are high-dimensional, with dimensions ranging from 2905-22283

b) The datasets are binary and multi-classified, with the number of instances ranging from 49-2133

c) The number of instances is much smaller than the number of features, which poses a challenge to the classification task
